            <p>Our industry of choice is policy makers and community advocates. Our findings and products can assist the
                government bodies, global and local organizations to collectively erase gender inequality in China,
                especially by providing more education opportunities for girls and women.

                <h2>Impact and Goals</h2>
                <p>Education is a human right. When it comes to gender equality,
                    universal and fair access to educational opportunities should be a key area of concern.
                    Our project aims to highlight differences in educational opportunities and resources across
                    different
                    regions in China. How do gender ratio and time as well as regions correlate with educational
                    opportunities
                    of Chinese girls and women? Disparity in educational resources start from primary education and
                    extend
                    all the way to higher education. While our study will primarily focus on educational attainment
                    level,
                    we attempt to uncover the bigger picture of how education is essential while evaluating and
                    improving
                    gender equality across China.</p>
                <p>
                    The United Nationâ€™s Education 2030 Agenda points out that government bodies hold the main
                    responsibility
                    for ensuring the right to quality education, and at the same time it is a universal and collective
                    commitment. Our project will provide useful insights for policy makers and contribute to the
                    progress
                    towards a more equal future for the education of girls and women in China.

                    <p>As of 2006, China's gender population gap was at its minimum. The population percentage
                        difference between male and female was 1.08%.</p>
                    <p>
                        However, the gap grows wider and wider after that year.</p>

                    <p>As of 2021, the gap becomes 2.34%, which almost doubled during the 15 years.</p>

                    <h4 class="display-5">Gender Ratio by Region</h4>
                    <p>Over the course of 22 years, the gender ratio (female population / male population) increased for
                        coastal regions, while decreased for mountain regions like Tibet and Xinjiang.</p>
                    <p>
                        Even for some major cities like Shanghai and Beijing, the gender ratio dropped drastically. Take
                        Shanghai as an example, in 1999 the gender ratio was 1.02, but in 2021 the ratio dropped to
                        0.93, which is an 8.69% decrease.</p>
                    <p>
                        However, there are also some provinces experienced the opposite. Jilin province's gender ratio
                        changed from 0.96 to 1.00 during the 22 years.</p>

                    <h4 class="display-5">Mean yearly illiterate ratios from 1999 to 2021</h4>
                    <p>The illiterate ratios = the # of illiterate population of a gender / the # of population of the
                        gender above 15 years old</p>
                    <p>
                        From 1999 to 2021, female illiterate ratios (purple line) were constantly higher than male
                        illiterate ratios (green line), suggesting unequal access to educational resources between
                        genders. Females had less access to elementary education than males.</p>
                    <p>
                        Good news is that both female and male illiterate ratios have been decreasing, and the gender
                        gap (orange bars) has been reducing as well. Although till 2021 females were still having a
                        larger illiterate ratio than males, the gender gap is as small as 3.9%. At least for the access
                        to elementary education, the inequality between genders is decreasing.

                    <h4 class="display-5">Mean regional gender gap of illiterate ratios</h4>
                    <p>Overall, the whole country has demonstrated reduced gender gaps, as shown by the lighter orange
                        colours from 1999 to 2021.
                    </p>

                    <p>Some regions started with relatively larger gender gaps, but the gaps have been lowered to less
                        than 10% since 2012. Some of the regions were in the inner land, such as Gansu, Qinghai and
                        Guizhou, which were less strong in economies. Some of the regions were on the eastern coast,
                        such as Shandong, Jiangsu, and Fujian, which had strong economies. Only one region remained in a
                        gender gap larger than 15% until 2021, which is Tibet.</p>
                    <p>It seems that the inequality between genders was not solely dependent on geographical locations
                        or economical power.</p>
