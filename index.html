            <p>Our industry of choice is policy makers and community advocates. Our findings and products can assist the
                government bodies, global and local organizations to collectively erase gender inequality in China,
                especially by providing more education opportunities for girls and women.

                <h2>Impact and Goals</h2>
                <p>Education is a human right. When it comes to gender equality,
                    universal and fair access to educational opportunities should be a key area of concern.
                    Our project aims to highlight differences in educational opportunities and resources across
                    different
                    regions in China. How do gender ratio and time as well as regions correlate with educational
                    opportunities
                    of Chinese girls and women? Disparity in educational resources start from primary education and
                    extend
                    all the way to higher education. While our study will primarily focus on educational attainment
                    level,
                    we attempt to uncover the bigger picture of how education is essential while evaluating and
                    improving
                    gender equality across China.</p>
                <p>
                    The United Nation’s Education 2030 Agenda points out that government bodies hold the main
                    responsibility
                    for ensuring the right to quality education, and at the same time it is a universal and collective
                    commitment. Our project will provide useful insights for policy makers and contribute to the
                    progress
                    towards a more equal future for the education of girls and women in China.

                        population percentage (green line), suggesting an uneven gender distribution over the entire
                        country.</p>
                    <p>As of 2006, China's gender population gap was at its minimum. The population percentage
                        difference between male and female was 1.08%.</p>
                    <p>
                        However, the gap grows wider and wider after that year.</p>

                    <p>As of 2021, the gap becomes 2.34%, which almost doubled during the 15 years.</p>

                    <p>Over the course of 22 years, the gender ratio decreased for

                    <p>
                        Even for some major cities like Shanghai and Beijing, the gender ratio dropped drastically.</p>

                        However, there are also some provinces experienced the opposite. Jilin province's gender ratio
                        changed from 1.04 to 0.997 during the 22 years.</p>
                    <p>Sadly, the overall gender ratio gets worsening during these years, which suggests a sign of
                        inequality.</p>

                    <p>The illiterate ratios = the # of illiterate population of a gender / the # of population of the

                    <p>
                        From 1999 to 2021, female illiterate ratios (purple line) were constantly higher than male
                        illiterate ratios (green line), suggesting unequal access to educational resources between
                        genders. Females had less access to elementary education than males.</p>
                    <p>
                        Good news is that both female and male illiterate ratios have been decreasing, and the gender
                        gap (orange bars) has been reducing as well. Although till 2021 females were still having a
                        larger illiterate ratio than males, the gender gap is as small as 3.9%. At least for the access
                        to elementary education, the inequality between genders is decreasing.

                    <p>Overall, the whole country has demonstrated reduced gender gaps, as shown by the lighter orange
                        colours from 1999 to 2021.
                    </p>

                    <p>Some regions started with relatively larger gender gaps, but the gaps have been lowered to less
                        than 10% since 2012. Some of the regions were in the inner land, such as Gansu, Qinghai and
                        Guizhou, which were less strong in economies. Some of the regions were on the eastern coast,
                        such as Shandong, Jiangsu, and Fujian, which had strong economies. Only one region remained in a
                        gender gap larger than 15% until 2021, which is Tibet.</p>
                    <p>It seems that the inequality between genders was not solely dependent on geographical locations
                        or economical power.</p>

                    <p class="lead">We have collected “currently enrolled students” stats from 1999 to 2015 in the PRC
                        and compared the student numbers in both men and women in each educational category: Higher
                        Education, Secondary Education and Primary Education. </p>

                    <p>The number of male and female students have both been dropping in recent years, this is likely
                        due to the one-child policy and the decreased birth date overall. In the Primary Education
                        category, it has been dropping at least since the year of 1999. In the Secondary Education
                        category, we see the downward trend of both men and women starting around 2005 and 2006.
                    </p>

                    <p>However, in terms of higher education, the overall student enrollment has consistently increased
                        in the past 20 years. It is also interesting to see that in 2009, the number of enrolled female
                        students exceeded the number of enrolled male students. It did not slow down from there, the
                        gender gap continues to increase yearly after 2009. </p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, stats regarding enrolled student gender are no longer available in the published
                        data set by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics, which is the reason why our analysis in
                        this project cannot go beyond the year 2015 yet. </p>

                    <p>As the overall student enrollment has consistently increased in the past 20 year, we know that
                        this is not a phenomenon in China alone, in fact, it is part of an international movement where
                        in recent years, <a
                            href="https://data.oecd.org/eduatt/population-with-tertiary-education.htm">women have become
                            the majority on college campuses in many countries around the
                            globe</a>. At the same time, while diving deeper into the data, we discover that while there
                        were
                        more women overall enrolled in college in China, there is an uneven distribution of the gap -
                        the highest differences are reflected in the undergraduate departments, while the traditional
                        gender gap very much remains in the postgraduates field at the highest educational level
                        (Postgraduates - Doctor’s Degree).

                    <p>The large gender gap might have surprised you in the [All Educational Levels] diagram, however,
                        keep in mind that China has a large population gender gap to begin with. In this diagram, we
                        focused on comparing the population gender ratio from 2010 with the enrolled students gender
                        ratio at each educational level. The population gender ratio is estimated according to the 2010
                        census. </p>

                    <p>For the primary education category, the population gender ratio represents the gender ratio in
                        children aged from 6 to 12. For the secondary education category, age 12 to 18. For the higher
                        education category, age 18 to 27. The gender ratio difference is much smaller in the primary
                        education level. It is at the secondary education level we start to see the significant
                        difference. While the gender ratio for the overall population of this age group is only at
                        1.0673, the educational gender gap is at 1.4390, which means for every girl that’s enrolled in
                        secondary education, 1.44 boys are enrolled. This shows that the opportunity of education is
                        very uneven between the two genders, this puts girls at a significant disadvantage early in
                        life.
